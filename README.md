# Calender Note Share

An app that allows users to add notes to a certain day for everyone to see.

## Code Organization 

All of our Java files are stored in the path `CalendarNoteShare/app/src/main/java/com/example/calendarapp/`
and all of our XML design files are stored in `CalendarNoteShare/app/src/main/res/layout/`

## How to run

Clone the app into Android Studio and build the program. Once built, run the program on an emulater using API 31 (it should default to that with the current settings)
